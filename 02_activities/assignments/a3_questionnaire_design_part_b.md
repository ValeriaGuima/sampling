# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

```
Yes, stratified random sampling is recommended because it helps ensure that the survey results are representative of the diverse experiences and perspectives within the company. 
This strategy minimizes sampling bias and provides more accurate insights into the specific factors affecting different employee groups.
Overall, this survey is well-structured and appropriate for a stratified random sampling approach. It should effectively capture a variety of factors that influence employee satisfaction and retention. The addition of consistent and clear question formats, along with a few additional questions, will enhance the survey's effectiveness in gathering comprehensive data.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.
```
To minimize error and improve the results, I would like to do some refinement of the answer choices. The following changes were made. 
Question 1, adjusted the wording for consistency (e.g., "Less than one year," "1-2 years," "3-4 years," etc.). For Question 3, included an option for employees who prefer not to disclose their salary.
Wording and Clarity: For Questions 6 and 7, chose more consistent response options ("yes," "somewhat," "no") to maintain uniformity.
Inadditional to those changes, included a question about intentions to stay at the company to directly gauge turnover intentions.

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?
```
An observational study involves observing subjects in their natural environment without any intervention by the researcher. While this approach can provide insights into natural behaviours and outcomes, it has limitations when applied to this scenario of understading employee turnover and satisfaction through a survey, some of the limitaitons are: 
*Lack of Control and Structured Data Collection:
Observational studies do not involve a structured data collection process like surveys or interviews. In this case, the company aims to gather specific, structured data about employee satisfaction and reasons for turnover.
*Potential for Observer Bias:
In observational studies, the preence of an observer can sometimes influence the behaviour of those being observed. This can skew the results and not accurately reflect the true reasons behind employee turnover.

Considering these factors among others, while observational studies are useful in many contexts, they are not the best approach for collecting specific, subjective information about employee experiecens and reasons for turnover in this situation.
A survey, especially with a stratified random sampling approach, is more appropriate as it directly collects relevant data from employees in a systematic way.

	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric
